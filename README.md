>**This is one of my first projects in Python and my first commit to github and my own repository.**

>If anyone wishes to improve upon it and recommit maybe we could use this as a building block to something truly remarkable and exciting as a tool to help everyone as an assistant locally and globally for free.

>This is not my original code it is a project I used to learn and grow from which was written by another programmer.

>All who wish to contribute may do so all I ask is that it is with good intentions and to help the project overall.
